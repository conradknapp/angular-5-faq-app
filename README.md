## Angular 5 FAQ App

Man, projects take a long time to install using the Angular CLI (I'm using version 1.7.4). It took 1883 seconds to download all the needed dependencies, according to my terminal.

And the webpack config apparently took 45297ms to build everything from scratch. Is developing with Angular really like this? Or do all Angular developers have really powerful machines.
